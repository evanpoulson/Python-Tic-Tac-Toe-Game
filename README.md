# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a tic tac toe game made using python, as part of the Python Zero to Hero course I am learning on Udemy.
This game uses a list to store all the board information, and functions which continually update the board based on user input to play.
I am particularly proud of box 13, where all the the functions come together to make the game playable. 
This game took me roughly six hours to create from scratch, and I am very proud of how well it turned out.
